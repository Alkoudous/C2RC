# C2RC

The goal of the Civil Registry Reconstitutions Cleaner (C2RC) is to help assess the correctness of computed reconstitutions of individuals.

C2RC evaluates the quality of the reconstitutions generated by the BurgerLinker tool based on sets of soft and hard rules. For instance, a reconstitution is unlikely when an individual is mentioned in two birth certificates. In this case, the ‘hard rule’ stating that a person can only be born once is broken. A ‘soft rule’ is based on the assumption that consecutive children for example cannot be born more than ten years apart. The rules are inspired by the expected structure of an extended family.
